About
=====

GProject is an extension of Geany's project management displaying a tree of files
belonging to the project in the sidebar. In addition, it enables complete indexing
of the project files (and having code completion, syntax highlighting and tag 
definition/declaration jumps for the whole project) quick swapping between header 
and source files, improved opening of includes, searching project files by name 
and more. External directories can be attached to the project to extend the plugin's
functionality to related directories outside the project tree. The plugin was created
with big projects in mind so everything works fast enough even with projects consisting
of tens of thousands of files.

Why was it created?
-------------------

A project in Geany is completely file-agnostic when it comes to the question of
what files are stored in the project. In principle the information that Geany stores
for every project is:

* project's base directory
* build settings
* list of open files

This approach is fine for smaller projects where most of the project files
are stored in a single directory but doesn't work very well with projects consisting
of many deeply nested directories containing thousands of files. For such projects
an expandable tree showing all the project files is a better alternative making it much
easier to to navigate among various project directories. Knowing which files
belong to the project makes it possible to add other useful features like project file
indexing, header/source swapping or file searching.

Why are files belonging to a project defined by patterns?
---------------------------------------------------------

Maintaining a list of project files is rather painful with larger projects consisting
of thousands files and many developers working on them. Files are created, deleted
and moved quite frequently and after each change the project has to be updated manually.
Instead, GProject defines a list of files belonging to the project implicitly using:

* project's base directory
* a list of glob-like patterns (e.g. \*.c, \*.h, or just simply \* if you want to 
  see everything)

Every file under the base directory matching the patterns is included into the project
and updating the file list is as simple as pressing the refresh button in the sidebar.

What are the differences between GProject and GeanyPrj?
-------------------------------------------------------

There is another project-management Geany plugin - GeanyPrj. GProject and GeanyPrj differ
in several aspects:

* GProject is an extension of Geany's project so every Geany project is a GProject
  at the same time and vice versa. On the other hand, GeanyPrj project is a separate
  project so if you want to set build properties for a GeanyPrj project, you have to
  set up a second Geany project in parallel.
* GeanyPrj can display several projects in the sidebar; even though only a single project
  can be opened with GProject at one time, similar effect can be achieved with the 
  "external directories" feature.
* GProject displays full tree in the sidebar while GeanyPrj displays only two-level
  tree (full directory name as a parent and a list of files under the directory).
* GProject has configurable file patterns while patterns in GeanyPrj are hard-coded
* GProject offers header/source swapping
* GProject offers finding project files by name and improved include file opening

Usage
=====

Project configuration
---------------------

Upon project creation, you should define the list of file patterns under the
Project->Properties Project tab. For instance, for a typical open source C project,
use patterns "\*.c \*h \*.am \*.ac" to see the source files together with
automake and autoconf files. If no patterns are defined (default), GProject treats 
this as the "\*" pattern in which case all files under the project directory are
displayed. After closing the dialog, the files matching the patterns
should appear in the sidebar under the Project tab (unless the GProject plugin
was loaded for the first time and Geany project was already open - see Known Issues 
for more details).

Additional settings are available from the GProject tab under the Project properties
dialog. You can define patterns to distinguish between header and source files for
C-like languages. This information is used for header/source swapping.

In addition, you can define patterns for directories that should be ignored when
searching for files belonging to the project. These will typically be various
VCS or hidden directories.

Finally, you can specify whether the tag manager should be used to index all the project
files or not. The default settings is Auto which means that if the total number
of project (and external directory) files is less than 500, tags are generated.
This is a rather conservative number, at least for an SSD disk - GProject was tested 
with tens of thousands project files and even though the initial scanning may take 
some time (for the linux kernel with 35000 files and 2300000 tags it takes about 
20s with a SSD disk), the work with the project is completely normal afterwards.
However, with ordinary HDD expect only around 100 scanned files per second because
of slow random access time.

Sidebar
-------

The sidebar contains a tree of files belonging to the project and external directory
trees (drawn with gray background to distinguish them from ordinary project files). 
Directories can be expanded by double-clicking them; the same action is used to open 
files. When a sidebar item is right-clicked, a context menu appears:

* Expand all - recursively expands all the subdirectories of the given directory
* Find in files - opens the Find in files dialog and sets the search directory
  to the clicked directory
* Find file - opens the Find file dialog and sets the search directory to the
  clicked directory
* Remove external directory - removes a previously added external directory from
  the project

The following actions can be invoked from the sidebar's toolbar:

* Reload all - reloads the project file tree. This is useful when files were added or
  removed from the project.
* Add external directory - adds an additional directory related to the project (e.g.
  it is useful to have the geany project as an external directory for the geany-plugins 
  project). External directories are indexed using the tag manager, and basically 
  all GProject features work with external directories too (find file or find in files
  from the context menu, swap header/source, open selected file, tag definition/declaration
  jumps, and active editor following). Apart from adding related projects, one of the
  possible uses is the addition of system header directories, e.g. /usr/include/gtk-2.0,
  and having them indexed for code completion and syntax highlighting.
* Expand all - recursively expands all the directories
* Collapse to project root - collapses all the directories except for the project root
* Follow active editor - automatically selects the current file in the sidebar
  when the user switches to another file. It auto-expands the tree to reveal the selected
  file. On by default.

Project menu entries
--------------------

GProject adds some extra entries under the Project menu:

* Find in Project Files - opens the Find in files dialog and sets the search directory
  to the base directory of the project
* Find Project File - opens the Find file dialog which can be used to find files
  within the project or external directories
* Swap Header/Source - if the current file matches one of the source patterns from
  the properties, it opens a project file with the same base name (without extension)
  matching header patterns (and vice versa). If the files are already open, it
  just switches the document tabs. Nothing happens if no matching file is found.

Each of these entries can be assigned a key binding under Edit->Preferences->Keybindings.

Find file dialog
----------------

The Find file dialog can be invoked either from the Project menu or from the
sidebar's context menu. Searches are performed recursively, starting from the
"Search inside" directory. All files having the searched string as a substring of their
name are displayed in the Messages window. Clicking the file name opens the file.
The following search properties are configurable:

* Case sensitive - specifies whether the searches should be case-sensitive
* Search in full path - when not checked, the search is performed in the file
  name only (excluding path); when checked, the search is performed in the full path

Editor context menu
-------------------

GProject adds an extra entry into the context menu of the editor:

* Open Selected File (GProject) - contrary to the Open Selected File entry present
  in Geany it also searches for the file in project files and external directories

Known issues
============

* When the plugin is loaded from the Plugin Manager for the first time and a project
  is already open, no files are displayed in the sidebar. The workaround is to
  reload the project in this case. The issue is caused by Geany only passing the project
  configuration file to a plugin when the project is opened, which isn't the case when
  the plugin is loaded.
* There might be some issues with UTF8 file names - the testing has been very
  limited.
* GProject hasn't been tested under Windows so there might be issues. Patches are welcome.
